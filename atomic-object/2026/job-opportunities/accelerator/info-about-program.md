Atomic Accelerator
Do more with your first two years post-grad.

What's the Accelerator?
The Atomic Accelerator is an accelerated professional development program for newly-graduated developers who join Atomic Object each spring.

Why join the Accelerator?
You'll hit the ground running
This is not a glorified internship. You’ll join our team as a full-fledged Atom, with the same benefits, pay scale, and responsibilities as other Atoms—including working on real software projects for Atomic clients.
You'll join a team within a team.
Become part of the Accelerator team, a small group of new grads learning and working together. You'll also connect with the larger Atomic team and spend time with company leadership.
You'll get coached for success.
Dive into a guided curriculum that will polish your consultant skills and teach you to make problem-solving software for our clients. You’ll also get weekly coaching and feedback from experienced Atoms.
You'll keep on learning.
Attend two development conferences each year, plus local events and user groups. Atomic is serious about ongoing learning and contributing to the larger development community.
You'll jump start your career.
Get ahead in your career by joining a consultancy, where you’ll work directly with clients and use new platforms/languages every 4-6 months. You’ll quickly gain a larger knowledge base and professional network than your friends at product companies.
You'll be an Atom.
Join a tight-knit group of makers working in an atmosphere of friendship, collaboration, and respect. Atomic is a transparent, employee-owned company that takes great care of its employees. We're also making the software community stronger, smarter, and more diverse.

Jacob Williams
The Accelerator Program has provided ample opportunity to fast-track my growth as a young professional. I particularly enjoy that the experience is tailored around mentorship and collaboration. It allows for truly creative problem-solving as we explore various technologies and define for ourselves what it means to be a professional in this industry.


Jared Surato
The Accelerator Program has given me the opportunity to develop both technically and personally at a rate that far exceeds what I would expect from my first year. Having the freedom to decide what skills I want to develop has allowed me to grow where I am interested rather than what the company mandates. My peers contribute to my progression as a professional and provide me with continued opportunities to learn about myself and my craft.


Maria Irimie
It’s amazing how much you can accomplish when given the support and guidance you truly need. After my first year in the Accelerator Program, I feel as though I’ve found a stable footing to begin my career. The opportunities for self-reflection, access to information, and continuous open discussions have made this past year one of immense growth and success.


Rebecca Rayford
The Accelerator Program has been a great way for me to gain real-life experience right out of college. With dedicated mentorship, I am constantly amazed by how quickly I’m able to catch on to new technologies and industry standards. Atomic’s dedication to professional growth and development is truly unmatched.

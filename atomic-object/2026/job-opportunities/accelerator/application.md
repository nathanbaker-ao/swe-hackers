Full Time
Entry Level
Atomic Object Software Consultant and Developer

Atomic is growing a diverse and inclusive team of curious, creative people who love crafting great software for our clients.

We're looking for thoughtful problem solvers who are passionate about software application development with a consultant mindset.

The Role

Atomic Accelerators join self-managed teams of 2-10 software developers. They collaborate alongside our designers, delivery leads, and testers to create products for our clients, from the idea phase through launch and beyond. Teams are project-based, so you'll get to work with new people and tackle new challenges approximately every 6-12 months.
 

As a software developer at Atomic, most of your time will be spent writing code alongside other Atoms. But your role isn’t limited to technical responsibilities. Atomic promises clients a great experience and a great product. Software developers deliver on that promise by being kind, curious, positive individuals who provide excellent high-level technical advice as software consultants.

Requirements

Applicants should be either:
 a) Working toward graduating with a Computer Science or related Bachelor's degree
 b) Recently graduated with a Computer Science degree
 c) A graduate of a non-C.S. program with experience in computer programming and the intention to transition to a career in software development.

Applicants must be willing and able to work in person from our office in Grand Rapids, MI.

The Company 

Since 2001, Atomic Object has created custom software products for web, mobile, desktop, and internet-connected devices. We were founded on the belief that not all software is created equal. Many people can write code, but it takes a close-knit team of passionate people to create exceptional, innovative products that change the way people do business.

We’re an employee-owned company with 120+ Atoms based in our Ann Arbor, Grand Rapids, Chicago, and Raleigh offices. With over 25 years of experience delivering custom software, we offer far more job stability than your average tech startup. Yet our distributed small offices and flat org structure provide a close-knit, personable workplace with no corporate ladder to climb.

Applying Today
If you're a hard-working, curious, thoughtful person who wants to create great software products, please fill out this application.

The salary range for this position is $30-$35/hour.

Atomic Object has a strategic goal to strengthen our company and the broader tech industry by increasing our employee diversity, pushing for and enacting more equitable and antiracist policies and practices. Research suggests that women and Black, Indigenous, or People of color (BIPOC) may self-select out of opportunities if they don’t meet 100% of the job requirements. We therefore encourage all interested candidates to apply for our positions regardless of perceived qualifications. We continue to work hard to make our interview and hiring process inclusive and equitable, and welcome any feedback from candidates to this end.

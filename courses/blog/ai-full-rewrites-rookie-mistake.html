      <p>You are staring at a messy file. The code works, but it is ugly. Inconsistent naming. Tangled logic. A few hacks that were supposed to be temporary six months ago. Your fingers itch to type: "Rewrite this entire file." AI makes it so easy. In thirty seconds, you could have a clean, beautiful version. The temptation is enormous. But if you give in, you are about to make the most common and most dangerous mistake in AI-assisted development.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">What Actually Happens During a Full Rewrite</h2>
    </section>

    <div class="text-block blog-block">
      <p>When you ask AI to rewrite a file, you are asking it to regenerate every single line. Even the lines that were already correct. Even the lines that contained subtle, hard-won fixes for edge cases that took weeks to discover. Even the lines whose exact formatting is load-bearing because another system parses the output.</p>
      <p>The AI does not know which lines are sacred and which are expendable. It treats everything as equally malleable. The result is a file that looks cleaner but has undergone hundreds of micro-changes, any one of which might alter behavior in ways that are invisible in a casual review.</p>
      <p>Here is what typically goes wrong. A function that previously returned <code>null</code> on empty input now returns <code>undefined</code>. A try-catch block that specifically caught <code>TypeError</code> now catches a generic <code>Error</code>. A string comparison that used <code>===</code> is now using a utility function that handles case-insensitivity -- an improvement in isolation, but a contract violation if callers depend on case-sensitive matching. A comment that documented a non-obvious business rule has been replaced with a generic JSDoc annotation that says nothing.</p>
      <p>Each of these changes is tiny. Each is nearly invisible in a diff where everything has changed. And each can cause a production failure that is extraordinarily difficult to trace back to the rewrite because the connection between "we cleaned up the code" and "payments are failing for users with empty middle names" is not obvious to anyone.</p>

        <div class="callout-title">The Silent Contract Violation</div>
        <div class="callout-text">The most dangerous bugs from AI rewrites are not the ones that fail loudly. They are the ones where the code still works for 95% of cases but silently breaks for edge cases that your existing tests do not cover. These bugs surface in production, weeks later, with no obvious connection to the rewrite.</div>

      <h2 class="section-title">The Diff Problem</h2>
    </section>

    <div class="text-block blog-block">
      <p>Code review depends on diffs. When you change three lines in a 200-line file, the reviewer can focus on those three lines, understand the intent, verify the correctness, and approve with confidence. The diff tells a story: here is what was, here is what changed, here is why.</p>
      <p>When AI rewrites an entire file, the diff is the entire file. Every line shows as deleted and re-added. The reviewer cannot distinguish between intentional behavioral changes and cosmetic reformatting. They cannot tell which modifications address the actual goal and which are AI's unsolicited "improvements." The diff is useless as a review artifact.</p>
      <p>Most reviewers, faced with a diff that touches every line, do one of two things: they either rubber-stamp it because reviewing the entire file from scratch is impractical, or they reject it because it is unreviewable. Neither outcome is good. The first ships unverified changes. The second wastes the work entirely.</p>
      <p>This is not a minor inconvenience. Reviewable diffs are a cornerstone of software quality. When you make diffs unreadable, you disable one of the most important quality gates in your development process. You are essentially saying, "Trust the AI" -- which is exactly the mindset that leads to production incidents.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">The Alternative: Surgical, Scoped Changes</h2>
    </section>

    <div class="text-block blog-block">
      <p>The solution is not to avoid AI. The solution is to use AI differently. Instead of "rewrite this file," you ask AI to make specific, scoped changes. Each change targets one function, one behavior, one pattern. Each produces a small, reviewable diff. Each can be verified independently.</p>
      <p><strong>Instead of:</strong> "Rewrite this user authentication module to be cleaner."</p>
      <p><strong>Try:</strong> "Rename the variable <code>x</code> in the <code>validateSession</code> function to <code>sessionToken</code> for clarity. Do not change any logic."</p>
      <p>Then, as a separate request: "Extract the token parsing logic from <code>validateSession</code> into a new private function called <code>parseTokenPayload</code>. Preserve the existing behavior exactly."</p>
      <p>Then: "Add explicit return type annotations to all exported functions in this file. Do not change any implementation."</p>
      <p>Each of these produces a clean, focused diff. Each can be reviewed in seconds. Each preserves existing behavior while making one specific improvement. Strung together, they achieve the same goal as a full rewrite -- cleaner, better-structured code -- but through a series of verifiable steps instead of one giant leap of faith.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">How to Phrase Prompts That Produce Minimal Diffs</h2>
    </section>

    <div class="text-block blog-block">
      <p>The key to getting surgical changes from AI is how you phrase the request. Here are the patterns that consistently produce minimal, verifiable diffs.</p>
      <p><strong>Use "modify" instead of "write" or "create."</strong> The word "modify" signals that existing code should be preserved. "Modify the handleSubmit function to validate email format before sending the request" produces a targeted addition. "Write a handleSubmit function that validates email and sends a request" produces a complete replacement.</p>
      <p><strong>Explicitly name what should not change.</strong> "Add retry logic to the fetchData function. Do not change the function signature, the error types, or the caching behavior." Every constraint you add is a line the AI will not cross.</p>
      <p><strong>Provide the existing code.</strong> Paste in the function you want modified. When AI can see what exists, it edits rather than invents. When it cannot see the code, it generates from imagination.</p>
      <p><strong>Ask for one thing at a time.</strong> Resist the urge to combine multiple changes into one prompt. "Add input validation, improve error messages, and refactor the helper functions" is three changes masquerading as one. Each deserves its own prompt, its own diff, and its own review.</p>
      <p><strong>Use the phrase "preserve the contract."</strong> This phrase is remarkably effective at preventing AI from making unsolicited changes to function signatures, return types, or error behavior. "Refactor the internal logic of processPayment while preserving its contract with all callers" tells the AI that the function's external behavior is sacred even as its internals change.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">When Full Rewrites Are Actually Okay</h2>
    </section>

    <div class="text-block blog-block">
      <p>There are rare situations where a full rewrite makes sense. If the file is brand new and has no callers yet, there is no contract to break. If you are converting a file from JavaScript to TypeScript as a deliberate migration, the diff will be large by nature. If the existing code is so fundamentally broken that preserving any of it would be harmful, starting over might be the right call.</p>
      <p>But even in these cases, the rewrite should be a conscious, deliberate decision -- not the default. And the resulting code should still be reviewed as carefully as any other change. "AI wrote it" is not a substitute for "a human verified it."</p>
      <p>The discipline of surgical, scoped changes is not just about avoiding bugs. It is about building a professional practice where every change is intentional, every diff tells a story, and every commit can be understood by the next developer who reads the log. The workshop teaches diff-based development as a core discipline because it is the skill that separates developers who use AI effectively from developers who use AI recklessly.</p>

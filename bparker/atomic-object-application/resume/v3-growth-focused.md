## Why I'm Ready for Atomic's Accelerator

I've built my technical foundation through coursework, self-study, and hands-on projects. I've learned what it means to deliver for clients through enterprise deployments. I've developed communication and problem-solving skills through customer-facing roles. And I've proven I can balance it all—work, learning, and raising two children—while continuing to grow.

Now I'm ready for an environment that will accelerate that growth even further. I'm ready to learn from experienced consultants, work on real client projects, and become the software developer I've been building toward.

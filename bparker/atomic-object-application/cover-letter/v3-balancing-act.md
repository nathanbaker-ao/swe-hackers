**Dear Hiring Manager,**

Every morning before my nine-year-old daughter heads to school and my three-year-old son starts his day, I've already spent an hour studying data structures. By the time they're in bed, I've pushed code to a project I'm building with engineers in a Discord community. In between, I'm working full-time, managing a household, and preparing for the next step in my career.

This isn't a story about being busy. It's a story about what happens when you know exactly what you want and you're willing to build the systems to get there.

I want to be a software consultant at Atomic Object.

My Computer Science coursework at Davenport University gave me a foundation I've never stopped building on. C# became my first language—not just syntax, but the *thinking*: dependency injection, separation of concerns, modular design, control flow. I built console applications, desktop apps with GUIs, and even 2D and 3D games with physics engines and real-time rendering.

But coursework was just the beginning. I taught myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm currently taking AI courses and building AI-powered tools. I'm contributing to an education technology platform alongside other engineers, attending meetings, working with partners, and shipping real features.

What makes me confident I'll thrive at Atomic isn't just my technical background—it's how I've learned to work. Consulting demands prioritization, clear communication, and the ability to context-switch without losing quality. Parenting two children while pursuing technical excellence has made those skills second nature.

At MCPc, I deployed Windows 10 systems for enterprise clients including Meijer, Steelcase, and Spectrum. I collaborated with cross-functional teams under tight deadlines. I learned what it means to deliver for clients who expect precision and professionalism. That experience showed me I want more than technical execution—I want to be part of the conversation from the beginning, helping clients understand what's possible and building solutions that truly serve their needs.

The Accelerator program's structure—real client work, weekly coaching, a curriculum designed to develop consulting skills—is exactly what I'm looking for. I've spent years building my technical foundation while managing the complexity of real life. Now I'm ready for an environment that will push me further.

I live in Grand Rapids. I'm ready to work. And I'm excited about the possibility of joining a team that values craftsmanship as much as I do.

Thank you for considering my application.

**Sincerely,**  
Brittany Parker

**Dear Hiring Manager,**

When I was invited to compete in track in Australia, I learned something that changed how I approach everything: the difference between people who train and people who *prepare*. Training is showing up and doing the work. Preparing is studying the course, understanding the conditions, visualizing every scenario, and building systems that let you perform when it matters most.

That mindset is exactly why I'm drawn to Atomic Object and the Accelerator program.

My track career at Davenport University took me from Michigan to Hawaii to Australia—not because I was the most naturally gifted athlete, but because I was relentless about improvement. I analyzed my performance data, identified patterns in what worked, and iterated constantly. I learned that excellence isn't a destination; it's a discipline.

I've brought that same approach to software development. My Computer Science coursework at Davenport gave me a strong foundation in C#, where I learned to think in systems: dependency injection, separation of concerns, modular design. But I didn't stop at coursework. I built a personal finance tracker with a full GUI. I developed 2D and 3D games with physics engines, cameras, and real-time feedback loops. I taught myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because I wanted to bring my ideas to the web.

Today, I'm pushing further. I'm taking AI courses, building AI-powered tools, and diving deep into data structures and algorithms. I'm actively collaborating with engineers in a Discord community, contributing to an education technology platform that helps people learn to code. I'm not just learning—I'm shipping.

What excites me about Atomic Object is the consulting model. At MCPc, I deployed Windows 10 systems for enterprise clients like Meijer, Steelcase, and Spectrum. I know what it means to work under pressure, meet client expectations, and deliver with precision. But I want more than deployment—I want to build. I want to sit with clients, understand their problems deeply, and craft solutions from the ground up.

I'm also a mother of two—a nine-year-old daughter and a three-year-old son. Balancing parenthood with continuous learning and technical growth has taught me more about prioritization, communication, and resilience than any single job could. I know how to manage complexity because I live it every day.

The Accelerator's promise of coaching, real client work, and a tight-knit team isn't just appealing—it's exactly the environment where I thrive. I've spent my life preparing for opportunities like this. I'd be honored to bring that preparation to Atomic Object.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background, drive, and technical skills can contribute to your team.

**Sincerely,**  
Brittany Parker

**Dear Hiring Manager,**

When I was invited to compete in track in Australia during high school, I learned something that changed how I approach everything: the difference between people who train and people who *prepare*. Training is showing up and doing the work. Preparing is studying the course, understanding the conditions, visualizing every scenario, and building systems that let you perform when it matters most.

That mindset is exactly why I'm drawn to Atomic Object and the Accelerator program.

Those opportunities—Australia, Hawaii—came from years of structured discipline before I'd even graduated high school. That same discipline carried me to Davenport University, where I competed as a D2 athlete while pursuing Computer Science. Balancing the demands of collegiate athletics with rigorous coursework taught me how to manage competing priorities without compromising quality. It's a skill I've never stopped using.

Every morning before my nine-year-old daughter heads to school and my three-year-old son starts his day, I've already spent an hour studying data structures. By the time they're in bed, I've pushed code to a project I'm building with engineers in a Discord community. In between, I'm working full-time, managing a household, and preparing for the next step in my career.

This isn't a story about being busy. It's a story about what happens when you know exactly what you want and you're willing to build the systems to get there.

I want to be a software consultant at Atomic Object.

My Computer Science coursework at Davenport gave me a foundation I've never stopped building on. C# became my first language—not just syntax, but the *thinking*: dependency injection, separation of concerns, modular design, control flow. I built console applications, desktop apps with GUIs, and 2D and 3D games with physics engines, cameras, and real-time rendering.

But coursework was just the beginning. I taught myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because I wanted to bring my ideas to the web. Today, I'm pushing further—taking AI courses, building AI-powered tools, and diving deep into data structures and algorithms. I'm actively collaborating with engineers in a Discord community, contributing to an education technology platform that helps people learn to code. I'm not just learning—I'm shipping.

What excites me about Atomic Object is the consulting model. At MCPc, I deployed Windows 10 systems for enterprise clients like Meijer, Steelcase, and Spectrum. I know what it means to work under pressure, meet client expectations, and deliver with precision. But I want more than deployment—I want to build. I want to sit with clients, understand their problems deeply, and craft solutions from the ground up.

What makes me confident I'll thrive at Atomic isn't just my technical background—it's how I've learned to work. Consulting demands prioritization, clear communication, and the ability to context-switch without losing quality. Parenting two children while pursuing technical excellence has made those skills second nature. I know how to manage complexity because I live it every day.

The Accelerator program's structure—real client work, weekly coaching, a curriculum designed to develop consulting skills—is exactly what I'm looking for. I've spent years building my technical foundation while managing the complexity of real life. Now I'm ready for an environment that will push me further.

I live in Grand Rapids. I'm ready to work. And I'm excited about the possibility of joining a team that values craftsmanship as much as I do.

**Sincerely,**  
Brittany Parker

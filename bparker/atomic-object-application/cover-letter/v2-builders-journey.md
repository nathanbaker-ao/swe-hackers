**Dear Hiring Manager,**

The first real program I ever built was a console calculator in C#. It wasn't impressive—just basic arithmetic, some input validation, a clean output. But when it worked, something clicked. I realized I wasn't just writing code. I was building a system that could think.

That moment started a journey that hasn't stopped.

From that calculator, I moved to console applications that processed data with algorithms and returned meaningful output. Then came tic-tac-toe, a todo list manager, a password generator. Each project taught me something new about control flow, user input, and designing for real use cases.

But I wanted more. I wanted to build things people could actually *use*—not just in a terminal, but with real interfaces. So I built desktop applications: a personal finance tracker, a weather forecasting app, a note-taking system. These projects introduced me to graphical user interfaces and the libraries that power them. Suddenly, my code wasn't just functional—it was *usable*.

Then came game development, and everything leveled up. Working with 2D and 3D engines taught me about cameras, scenes, physics, graphics rendering, and real-time feedback. I built Super Mario-style platformers. I learned that software isn't just logic—it's experience.

I didn't stop there. I taught myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because I wanted to bring my ideas to the web. Today, I'm taking AI courses, building AI-powered tools, and deepening my understanding of data structures and algorithms. I'm collaborating with engineers in a Discord community, contributing to an education technology platform that's actively being used to teach people software development.

What draws me to Atomic Object is that you don't just build software—you build *products*. You work with clients from the idea phase through launch. You care about craftsmanship. That's the kind of work I want to do.

My experience at MCPc, deploying Windows 10 systems for enterprise clients like Meijer and Steelcase, taught me what it means to deliver under pressure and meet client expectations. But I want to go deeper. I want to be in the room when problems are defined, when architectures are designed, when solutions are crafted.

The Accelerator program is exactly the environment I've been preparing for—a place where I can learn from experienced consultants, work on real client projects, and continue the building journey that started with a simple calculator.

I'd be honored to bring my curiosity, my technical foundation, and my relentless drive to build to Atomic Object.

**Sincerely,**  
Brittany Parker
